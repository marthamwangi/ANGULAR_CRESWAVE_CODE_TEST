# Tasks

- ✅Create a new repository on your GitHub account named ANGULAR_CRESWAVE_CODE_TEST

### Project Overview

- ✅You are tasked with building a task management application using Angular.
- ✅application should allow users to view tasks in a table format, add new tasks, edit existing tasks, and delete tasks.
- ✅Use Angular Material for UI components and implement routing for navigating between different views.

### Task Requirements

#### Task table View

- ✅ Display tasks in a table format using Angular Material's table component.
- ✅ Each row should display the task's title, description, status
- ✅ (complete/incomplete) and actions (edit/delete).

#### Styling

- ✅Use Angular Material for UI components (table, buttons, forms, etc.) or Tailwind css for styling where applicable.
- []Apply responsive design principles.

### Evaluation

#### 1) Code Quality
